                <p>I graduated from Penn State in December 2019. I was working at
                    a restaurant in State College when I began my job search to
                    put that shiny new engineering degree into action. I wanted to
                    take my time to find the perfect position that  aligned with
                    my interests and skills. A few months went by and time was ticking
                    away along with my bank account balance.

                <div class="sub-heading">First Professional Role</div>
                <p>I got a job referral from a friend who was working for a construction
                    company in Washington D.C. It had a decent salary so given my financial
                    position, I took the job. I started out as assistant to the Project Manager
                    for a parking garage repair in Bethesda, MD. It was a hard job with early mornings,
                    long hours, hard labor, and hazardous working conditions. I was in a new world
                    going from college to heavy construction. Something didn't feel right at first
                    but I learned to roll with the punches. I was able to use my computer and report
                    writing skills to help out my employer by documenting the parking garage conditions,
                    allowance spending, and repair locations. Over a year into it I felt it was time 
                    to find a new job, preferrably something where I could use my college education.

                <div class="sub-heading">Materials Scientist</div>
                <p>I applied to a 3D printing company in Columbus, OH. They were looking for a materials
                    scientist to run their filament extrusion operation. To my surprise, I received a call
                    back on my application the next day. I took the job and moved to Columbus. I loved
                    working at that company. It was a small team, everyone was friendly, it was great
                    place to work. Also it was only 3 miles from my apartment so I frequently rode my bike
                    to work. My job was to run the extrusion machines to produce filament of various materials
                    and a spread of colors for each material type. Parallel to that, I worked on 
                    developing a materials testing program. We wanted to find the relationship between
                    print settings and properties of 3D printed objects. To start off I looked
                    into tensitle strength. I gathered information from ASTM D638 for the dimensions
                    of dogbone specimens and parameters udner which they would be tested. I also developed
                    methods for extruding new materials. I looked at time-temperature-transformation
                    diagrams for a starting point then fine-tuned the process through trial and error.
