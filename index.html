                            <p style="font-weight: 300;">I was 2 years away from finishing my degree
                                in Materials Science and Engineering at Penn State when I read the book 
                                "How We Learn" by Benedict Carey and
                                implemented his techniques to become a high achiever in my class. In my last
                                four semesters I got A's in nearly all my classes. Fast forward to December 2019 and things
                                were looking up for me. I was ready to take on the world.

                        <div class="sub-heading">Career Start
                        <p style="font-weight: 300;">I graduated from Penn State in December 2019. I was working at
                            a restaurant in State College when I began my job search to
                            put that shiny new engineering degree into action. I wanted to
                            take my time to find the perfect position that  aligned with
                            my interests and skills. A few months went by and time was ticking
                            away along with my bank account balance.

                <div class="sub-heading">First Professional Role</div>
                <p>I got a job referral from a friend who was working for a construction
                    company, Restoration East, in Washington D.C. It had a decent salary so given my financial
                    position, I took the job. I started out as assistant to the Project Manager
                    for a parking garage repair in Bethesda, MD. It was a hard job with early mornings,
                    long hours, hard labor, and hazardous working conditions. I was in a new world
                    going from college to heavy construction. Something didn't feel right at first
                    but I learned to roll with the punches. I was able to use my computer and report
                    writing skills to help out my employer by documenting the parking garage conditions,
                    allowance spending, and repair locations. Over a year into it I felt it was time 
                    to find a new job, preferrably something where I could use my college education.
                </p>
                <div class="sub-heading">Materials Scientist</div>
                <p>I applied to a 3D printing company in Columbus, OH. They were looking for a materials
                    scientist to run their filament extrusion operation. To my surprise, I received a call
                    back on my application the next day. I took the job and moved to Columbus. I loved
                    working at that company. It was a small team, everyone was friendly, it was great
                    place to work. Also it was only 3 miles from my apartment so I frequently rode my bike
                    to work. My job was to run the extrusion machines to produce filament of various materials
                    and a spread of colors for each material type. Parallel to that, I worked on 
                    developing a materials testing program. We wanted to find the relationship between
                    print settings and properties of 3D printed objects. To start off I looked
                    into tensitle strength. I gathered information from ASTM D638 for the dimensions
                    of dogbone specimens and parameters udner which they would be tested. I also developed
                    methods for extruding new materials. I looked at time-temperature-transformation
                    diagrams for a starting point then fine-tuned the process through trial and error.

                <div class="sub-heading">Move Back Home</div>
                <p>Later that year my two roommates (my brother and another friend from back home), 
                    decided to move back home. While I did not exactly want to leave, I also did not want
                    to be stuck with the $1700 a month rent payment since that would have been more than
                    half of my monthly wage. I resigned from my position at IC3D and moved back to the
                    Scranton area where I still reside today. I spent a few months working on home renovations
                    including a full bathroom remodel and replacing the walls and floors in a couple bedrooms.
                    A few months of that then I was ready to find a new job. I was determined to find something
                    good. And ..... then I ran out of money again. I took a job with PennDOT as a road maintenance
                    crew member. The group of guys I worked with was fantastic but the pay was not so much. My uncle
                    forwarded me a company that was looking to hire people immediately. It was more pay than what
                    I was currently making so I went for it.
                </p>
                <div class="sub-heading">Building Job Retention</div>
                <p>I began a job at IWDA Engineering as an office administrator. My job was to collect reports from
                    our technicians, review them, input them into digital formats, then send them to our clients.
                    There was some turmoil within the company - people got fired, people were hired, people quit.
                    I stayed. I was good at my job. Working with computers is easy for me and I was able to create
                    a new system for handling the reports to make turnover more efficient. I was sent out to cove
                    inspection here and there. Then I was scheduled to take certification tests for various inspections.
                    We didn't have a lot of technicians certified in ashpalt inspections so I was sent to State College
                    for that test. I passed and was transitioned to working in the field as an engineering technician.
                    I've been with the company for almost 2 years now and I am still longing to work in a materials
                    processing environment.
                </p>
                <div class="sub-heading">A Search for My New Home</div>
                <p>I am looking for a new role in materials engineering related discipline. I am interested in becoming
                    a Manufacturing Engineer, Process Engineer, Quality Control Specialist, or Materials Researcher for 
                    a company engaged in the production of engineered materials. I specifically would like to work with
                    metals, ceramics, semiconductors, or plastics but I am open to other fields of work. On the side, I began learning
                    software development, which is why I have created this website using HTML and CSS. I plan on delving
                    into JavaScript, Python, and SQL next. Given enough time and effort, these skills will become valuable
                    in the next stage of my career.
