                        <p>Analyzed moisture content of virgin PLA, ABS, and PETG polymer resins to implement standard drying procedure targeting 200 ppm moisture for each material. Compiled data to track changes in supplier quality and set standards for product acceptance.</p>
                        <p>Developed processing techniques for a new company product: PETG with 10%, 15%, and 20% chopped carbon fiber added. Found the ideal melt flow rate for 10% carbon fiber resin using 5 mm die, 450°F hot zone average, and extrusion back pressure of 65 MPa to keep material from sagging while maintaining diameter tolerance of ± 0.05 mm. Higher carbon fiber content required increased melt temperature while maintaining initial stage cooling bath at 55°F.</p>
                        <p>Trialed process for in-house recycling of PETG. Waste material was shredded with a Prosino PS-CM Grinder then manually sieved to exclude large particles. Performed batch trials ranging from 10%-100% recycled material mixed with virgin resin. Analyzed product in each trial and found that any ratio of recycled material can be produced within diameter tolerance, but increasing above 50% results in increased brittleness and surface defects. Hypothesized solution of adding a wash process after shredding or implementing a pelletizer machine.</p>
                        <p>Started the initial stage for a materials testing program within the company. The objective was to test tensile strength and flexural strength in line with ASTM D638 and D790 standards to compare modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and stiffness between parts printed in horizontal vs. vertical orientation. Worked with 3D Printing Service team to prototype specimens to be sent out for third-party testing. Performed in-house experiments for shrinkage comparing 3D model dimension with the fresh print and cooled print dimension of a 300 mm x 10 mm x 10 mm rectangle to determine (roughly) the percent shrinkage for company PLA, ABS, and PETG filaments.</p>
                        <p>Operated single-screw extrusion machine daily and performed routine maintenance: clean and inspect screws for wear, flushing feed throat, changing gearbox oil, and changing puller belts.</p>
